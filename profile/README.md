# Galamo
**Galamo** is a comprehensive Python package designed for astrophysical research, integrating machine learning and statistical methods for in-depth galaxy analysis. It automates tasks in morphology classification, kinematics, photometry, and spectral analysis, providing an easy-to-use toolkit for researchers working on galaxy properties, dynamics, and evolution.

`Note: Galamo is in early stage and building many modules to power the astronomers which will take some time to release. Thanks for supporting!`
